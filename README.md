e.g.
```bash
# Go to an example
...\week7-examples-and-exercises> cd basic-state-example
# Run the React example
...\week7-examples-and-exercises\basic-state-example> npm run dev
# Go back to parent directory 
...\week7-examples-and-exercises\basic-state-example> cd ..
...\week7-examples-and-exercises>
```
